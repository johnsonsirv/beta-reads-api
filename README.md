## Beta Reads API (PDF Books Review as a Service)

A platform where REVIEWERS can get free PDF books and submit reviews within 2 months. Upon submitting a review, user will be eligible for a new PDF book. These reviews will become helpful at a later stage for READERS.

After getting around 500 reviews of books, then the second stage will kick in.

READERS will subscribe monthly to read books.

PUBLISHERS / AUTHORS will join the platform to share links to their books and REVIEWERS will be assigned to make reviews.

The PUBLISHERS / AUTHORS can then use these reviews to sell thier books on AMAZON or any other marketplace.

## Product Road Map
At its early stages, I'm building this product and making it open. I dedicate some hours every week work on the product. There are smaller milestones, which I follow towards the final goal. 

#### 1st Stage (Reviewers)
 - Reviewers can sign up through a short onboarding step. Sign up confirmation email + SMS
 -  Admin will manually approve the profile, providing login details to the REVIEWER.
 - REVIEWER will be offered all the e-books. They can choose and subscribe to to one book, upon choosing one ebook, they agree to terms and condition to submit a review after finishing book.
 - Once subscribed / downloaded one ebook, they cannot download other ebooks, until a quality review is submitted.
 - Once review is submitted, ADMIN will approve or disapprove. Upon approval, they can subscribe to another e-book. REVIEWER can subscribe to maximum 10 books their life.

 #### Next Stage 1 (Readers)
 After getting around 500 reviews of books, then the second stage will kick in. A space for readers, monthly subscriptions, and mobile apps will be developed later.

 #### Next Stage 2 (Publishers / Authors)
 After building a community of READERS and REVIEWERS, publishers / authors can join the platform to buy quality reviews (a way to pay the reviewers) and use the reviews on marketplaces like AMAZON.
 Authors / Publishers can share their books on the platform, so that subscribed users can read their books (a pay to pay publishers / authors).
